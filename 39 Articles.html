          <header>I. Of Faith in the Holy Trinity</header>
          <article>
            <p>There is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body, parts, or passions; of infinite power, wisdom, 
  and goodness; the Maker, and Preserver of all things both visible and invisible.</p>
            <p>And in unity of this Godhead there be three Persons, of one substance, power, and eternity; the Father, the 
  Son, and the Holy Ghost.</p>

          <header>II. Of the Word or Son of God, Which Was Made Very Man</header>
          <article>
            <p>The Son, which is the Word of the Father, begotten from everlasting of the Father, the very and eternal God, 
  and of one substance with the Father, took Man’s nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance: 
  so that two whole and perfect Natures, that is to say, the Godhead and Manhood, were joined together in one 
  Person, never to be divided, whereof is one Christ, very God, and very Man; who truly suffered, was 
  crucified, dead, and buried, to reconcile his Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but 
  also for all actual sins of men.</p>

          <article>
            <p>As Christ died for us, and was buried, so also is it to be believed, that he went down into Hell.</p>

          <article>
            <p>Christ did truly rise again from death, and took again his body, with flesh, bones, and all things appertaining 
  to the perfection of Man’s nature; wherewith he ascended into Heaven, and there sitteth, until he return to 
  judge all Men at the last day.</p>

          <article>
            <p>The Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one substance, majesty, and glory, with the 
  Father and the Son, very and eternal God.</p>

          <header>VI. Of the Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation</header>
          <article>
            <p>Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be 
  proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the Faith, or be 
  thought requisite or necessary to salvation. In the name of the Holy Scriptures we do understand those 
  Canonical Books of the Old and New Testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church.</p>
            <p>Of the Names and Number of the Canonical Books</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Genesis</li>

            </ol>
            <p>And the other Books (as <i>Hierome</i> saith) the Church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners; 
    but yet doth it not apply them to establish any doctrine; such are these following:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The Third Book of Esdras</li>
              <li>The Fourth Book of Esdras</li>
              <li>The Book of Tobias</li>
              <li>The Book of Judith</li>
              <li>The rest of the Book of Esther</li>
              <li>The Book of Wisdom</li>
              <li>Jesus the Son of Sirach</li>
              <li>Baruch the Prophet</li>

              <li>The Second Book of Maccabees</li>
            </ol>
            <p>All the Books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we do receive, and account them 
    Canonical.</p>

          <header>VII. Of the Old Testament</header>
          <article>
            <p>The Old Testament is not contrary to the New: for both in the Old and New Testament everlasting life is 
                offered to Mankind by Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and Man, being both God and Man. 
                Wherefore they are not to be heard, which feign that the old Fathers did look only for transitory promises. 
                Although the Law given from God by Moses, as touching Ceremonies and Rites, do not bind Christian men, 
                nor the Civil precepts thereof ought of necessity to be received in any commonwealth; yet notwithstanding, 
                no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the Commandments which are called Moral.</p>
